In [Block I - Introduction to the BAM Data Store](block_1.md), we saw what is the BAM Data Store structure, and how it is based on two main ingredients to populate the data model with actual data: the Masterdata definitions (composed of object types, property types, and vocabularies) + the parent-child relationships.

At BAM, we already have defined Masterdata, see [bam-masterdata](https://github.com/BAMresearch/bam-masterdata). In some cases, these Masterdata might not be enough or is not specific enough for your use-case. For those cases, we will show you here how to create your own Github repository to define and work with the current and your newly-defined Masterdata. We will also show the collaborative platform ([WebProtégé](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/)).
